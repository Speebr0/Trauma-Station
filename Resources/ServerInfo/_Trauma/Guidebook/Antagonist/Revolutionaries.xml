  # Revolutionaries

  <Box>

  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists composed of the Nanotrasen working class, they need to take control of the station by building giant war factories.

  ## The Most Important Thing of All!
  As a head Revolutionary, you are a leader, not a frontliner, delegate tasks to your revolutionaries or they will not know what to do.

  ## Objectives
  You must kill, convert, or exile all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] on station in no particular order.

  Your objective is not to destroy the station, but [italic]take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]mace[/color], [color=cyan]two propaganda pamphlets[/color], [color=cyan]handcuffs[/color] and some starting [color=cyan]components[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevMace"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Handcuffs"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevPropaganda"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevGear"/>
  </Box>

  You can convert crew members to your side by stunning them with the [color=#ff0000]mace[/color], cuffing them, and reading [color=#ff0000]propaganda[/color] to them (by clicking them with propaganda in hand.)Be sure to take off the targets headset, otherwise they could call for help!

  Another hurdle in your way are [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - Visibly change appearance upon being implanted into a [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving away his cover and disabling your convert ability

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted with mindshields already.

  You are able to remove mindshields with [color=red]Shield Rippers[/color] once you unlock them.

  </Box>

  ## Factory Building and Tech

  The [bold][color=red]most important part[/color][/bold] of being a headrev is making proper factories, this allows you to expand your tech tree and get more [color=red]dangerous[/color] and powerful items to arm your revs with. Keep in mind that rev buildings are [color=red][bold]very loud[/bold][/color], and you will need to be isolated and have defenses before long!

  ### Industrial Forge

  You should [bold][color=red]ALWAYS[/color][/bold] start by making a forge, more than one if you can afford it. Good rev bases have 4-5 forges constantly producing parts.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevForge"/>
  </Box>

  It allows you to [color=cyan]create parts[/color] for other machines, as well as some basic armor and weaponry, this includes important items such as the mace, which is your primary stun weapon.

  Here are some example items it can make:
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevGear"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevNut"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevBolt"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterArmorRev"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevSwordBlade"/>
  </Box>

  ### Printing Press

  The printing press is the second most important rev building, it allows the [color=cyan]creation of propaganda[/color], your conversion item. However, it takes very long to produce, so you should create more than one.

 <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevPrintingPress"/>
  </Box>

  To get paper, you can have your revs print nanotasks from their PDA, and then craft it into paper for the press, dont be afraid to delegate!

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PaperNanoTaskItem"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPaper"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevPropaganda"/>
  </Box>

  ### Tier 2 Rev Tech

  After getting your basic factory setup, you can start branching out on the tech tree to get some T2 rev tech.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevPrinter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevRadioBench"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevMicroelectronicsAssembler"/>
  </Box>

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevUniformPrinter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevBulletPress"/>
  </Box>

  All of these buildings have unique requirements to make, such as a security encryption key for the telecommmunications workshop. Once you get these items you can use them to construct the said devices.

  These buildings give access to unique and powerfull items, here are a few examples:

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PinpointerCommand"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevGunParts"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingBeltRevWebbing"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EncryptionKeyRev"/>
  </Box>

  ### Tier 3 Rev Tech

  Tier 3 Rev tech is the best technology revs can scrap together. They all provide access to the strongest items avalible to the revolutionaries.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevTelesphere"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevTechAnalyzer"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevPlasmaFoundry"/>
  </Box>

  However; to make any of these you need to kill a head of staff! They all require unique items that no one but the heads of staff have access to.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="HandTeleporter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingShoesBootsMagAdv"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BoxFolderQmClipboard"/>
  </Box>

  Consider sending a strike team of revolutionaries to assassinate these heads of staff and retrieve the said items, any of them can be a gamechanger!

  Here are a few T3 rev tech items:

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RevCircuitBoard"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Killdozer"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CartridgeRocketRPG2HE"/>
  </Box>

  ## Revolutionary
  A [bold][color=red]Revolutionary[/color][/bold] is a crew member that has been converted by a [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold].

  [bold][color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] can't convert people themselves,[/bold] but they're more than capable of doing dirty work and carrying out orders.

  As a [bold][color=red]Revolutionary[/color][/bold] listen to your headrevs!
